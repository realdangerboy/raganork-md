Raganork was a basic WhatsApp bot framework built on top of the Baileys library. It supported basic commands, session management, and a plugin system for extending features.

This project has now been **rewritten from scratch** with major performance, stability, and architecture improvements. The new version, **Raganork-MD**, supports multi-session handling, persistent configuration, better caching, and is more production-ready.

## Legacy Features

* Basic command and event handling
* WhatsApp Web (Baileys) API integration
* Single-session auth
